# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a lightweight, CPU-only document intelligence system that extracts and ranks document sections based on persona-specific requirements and job contexts. The system operates without any ML models, ensuring compliance with the â‰¤1GB constraint and 60-second processing time limit.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
We utilize PyPDF2 for efficient PDF text extraction, implementing pattern-based section identification that recognizes document structures across diverse domains. The system employs enhanced regex patterns and content analysis to identify meaningful section titles, avoiding generic headers like "Introduction" in favor of specific titles such as "Coastal Adventures" or "Culinary Experiences."

### 2. Persona-Aware Analysis Engine
The core innovation lies in our rule-based persona classification system that maps user descriptions to predefined persona types (researcher, student, analyst, entrepreneur, journalist, travel planner). Each persona has associated keyword dictionaries and section priority weights that influence relevance scoring without requiring external models.

### 3. Multi-Factor Relevance Scoring
Content relevance is calculated using a weighted scoring system:
- **Persona keyword matching** (10% weight): Keywords specific to user expertise area
- **Section type priority** (30-90% weight): Domain-specific content preferences
- **Job-specific alignment** (15% weight): Dynamic keyword extraction from job description
- **Content quality metrics** (10% weight): Length, technical density, and structural indicators

### 4. Intelligent Content Refinement
For top-ranked sections, we extract key sentences using job-keyword density scoring and generate relevance explanations. This creates focused summaries highlighting why specific content matters to the user's task, all through algorithmic processing without ML inference.

## Performance Optimization

The system is optimized for speed through:
- Efficient text parsing with minimal regex operations
- Cached persona keyword lookups
- Streamlined scoring algorithms
- Parallel-ready section processing architecture

## Constraint Compliance

- **CPU-only execution**: Pure algorithmic approach with no ML models
- **Model size**: Zero external models, <50MB total codebase
- **Processing time**: Optimized for <60 seconds on 3-7 documents
- **Offline capability**: No internet dependencies, fully self-contained

## Generalization Strategy

The system handles diverse domains through flexible section pattern recognition, extensible persona keyword dictionaries, dynamic job requirement extraction, and adaptive content quality assessment, ensuring robust performance across academic papers, travel guides, financial reports, and various persona types.
